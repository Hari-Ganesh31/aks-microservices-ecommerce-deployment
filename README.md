# aks-microservices-ecommerce-deployment
Deployed a multi-microservice e-commerce application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Docker, Helm charts, and Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller.


# Multi-Microservice E-Commerce Deployment on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

# Project Overview
Deployed a multi-microservice e-commerce application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The application was containerized using Docker and deployed using Helm charts. 
Traffic routing was managed using Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller, enabling secure external access. 
This project demonstrates production-like Kubernetes deployment, scaling, and management on Microsoft Azure.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- ☁️ Microsoft Azure
- 🚢 Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- 📦 Docker
- ☸️ Kubernetes
- ⚓ Helm Charts
- 🌐 Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC)
- 🔧 kubectl, Helm CLI, Azure CLI

## 🎯 What I Implemented
✔ Understanding the microservices architecture  
✔ Deploying the application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)  
✔ Creating an AKS cluster and node pools  
✔ Installing and configuring Helm  
✔ Deploying the chart to the cluster  
✔ Configuring Azure ingress controller for external access  
✔ Troubleshooting pending pods and CPU/VM quota issues  
✔ Verifying application functionality

This project demonstrates my hands-on experience working with AKS,
Kubernetes deployments, Helm, and cloud infrastructure.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Real-world Kubernetes deployment workflow
- AKS cluster and node pool management
- Handling “Insufficient CPU” and scheduling issues
- How Helm simplifies Kubernetes deployments
- How ingress controllers manage external traffic
