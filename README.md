Deployed a multi-microservice e-commerce application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Docker, Helm charts, and Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller.


# Multi-Microservice E-Commerce Deployment on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

# Project Overview
Deployed a multi-microservice e-commerce application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The application was containerized using Docker and deployed using Helm charts. 
Traffic routing was managed using Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller, enabling secure external access. 
This project demonstrates production-like Kubernetes deployment, scaling, and management on Microsoft Azure.
